# Monopoly-Game

Simulates a game of monopoly on a JApplet user interface.

This was a project done in my sophomore year of college for a class where I was learning Java and SQL.

Coded in Netbeans IDE.
All of the classes are under the src folder, and the class named "Interface.java" is where the main method is, and most of the code controlling the game's behavior is located.

This was the first project where I felt I had a strong understanding of how the code all comes together to build a UI for the end user.
