# Monopoly-Game

Simulates a game of monopoly on a JApplet user interface.

This was a project done in my sophomore year of college for a class learning Java and SQL.

Coded in Netbeans IDE.
The main method is located in the "Monopoly2.java" file, and most of the coding for the behavior of the game was done in "Interface.java". 
The zip file to download the full project can be found at "Monopoly.zip".

This was the first project where I felt I had a strong understanding of how the code all comes together to build a UI for the end user.
